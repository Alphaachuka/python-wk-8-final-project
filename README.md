# 📊 CORD-19 Research Paper Analysis & Streamlit Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 research papers using the **CORD-19 metadata dataset**.  
The workflow includes data loading, cleaning, exploration, visualization, and building an interactive **Streamlit web app** to explore research trends.

## 🎯 Objectives

✔ Load and explore the metadata dataset  
✔ Clean the dataset (handle missing values, format dates, extract features)  
✔ Analyze publication trends, top journals, and word frequency in titles  
✔ Visualize insights using bar charts, line charts, and word cloud  
✔ Build a Streamlit dashboard to interactively explore the data  
✔ Document findings and challenges
